# Array-Shuffler

An array shuffler that uses the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm to shuffle the array in place. Basically the shuffler takes 2 cards, a random card and the card from the back of the deck, and makes them swap positions. The number of 'shuffles' depends on the number of the cards in the deck.
